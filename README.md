# Real-Time EDF-VD with MSRP
Overview
This project is dedicated to implementing a scheduling algorithm specifically designed for mixed-criticality systems in real-time environments. The focus is on integrating the Earliest Deadline First with Virtual Deadlines (EDF-VD) algorithm alongside the Multiprocessor Synchronization Protocol for Real-Time (MSRP) to handle resource sharing constraints effectively. This implementation aims to enhance system responsiveness and ensure timely task completion in critical system operations, making it highly suitable for applications requiring stringent temporal guarantees.
